Other systems have similar structures. The probate process can be expensive in both time and money. One benefit of traditional legal trusts is that assets held in a trust do not go through the probate process. The assets are already in the trust; the trust continues to function through the death. A dtrust can also avoid the expensive probate process. </p><p id="eee9d5b4-1bab-4f8a-bae5-bcbf7ef842e7" className="">
</p><p id="b8b6aa62-bf14-4bd3-a49b-8508a28f0a09" className=""><strong>How costly is probate?</strong> Court fees, attorney fees, appraisal fees, executor fees, bond fees, etc. all diminish the value that is ultimately passed on from a decedent&#x27;s estate. These costs typically take 3% to 7% of total estate assets. </p><p id="d5635d7b-1c52-43aa-bd73-692e5278abf2" className="">
</p><p id="6b9bec0a-faac-4080-b74d-599aada6739c" className=""><strong>How long does probate take?</strong> This will vary with the complexity of the estate, but one to two years is not uncommon. </p><p id="3cea71ec-b261-44fc-b94c-233b524388e0" className="">

They each own a home, a little cash, and 0.5 BTC. They each have two adult children. They both want their BTC to be split evenly between their respective children. </p><p id="d744cc3b-6395-43b8-b68f-458ff79e8fdd" className="">A speaks with an attorney who helps A draft a will. The will stipulates that the BTC will be split between the children. The attorney charges a small fee. When A dies, the BTC goes into probate along with A&#x27;s other assets. The probate process lasts several months. The probate court takes fees and the estate might need to hire a lawyer to handle any disputes. Eventually, whatever is left of the BTC after the fees are paid will be split between A&#x27;s children. </p><p id="1aaa7d16-6b87-48d4-bd90-5bcb7b01224d" className="">S decides to use a dtrust. He visits <a href="http://dtrust.io">dtrust.io</a> to form the dtrust. He keeps it quite simple. He creates two beneficiary wallets for his children, and he schedules the BTC to be split evenly between those wallets in ten years. He gives the control of the beneficiary wallets to his children. S keeps just a revocation key for himself to be used in case he really needs the BTC before he dies. S&#x27;s friend agrees to be the trustee, so S gives that friend control of a trustee wallet with a distribution schedule control key. Each year 0.0025 BTC (0.5%) is paid in fees to DTrust. When S dies, the BTC does not go into probate. The dtrust will distribute the BTC according to its schedule. The trustee uses the distribution schedule control key to change the distribution schedule to immediately distribute the BTC to the children&#x27;s wallets. </p><p id="0f40cd3f-a0cb-4269-8390-79455f908d24" className="">S saved time and money compared to A. </p></details></li></ul><p id="b900e2a1-d907-45fa-a14b-7023297a67fe" className="">
