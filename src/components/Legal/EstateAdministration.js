Settlors can ensure that their assets are distributed as desired no matter what happens long into the future. </p><h2 id="0d183651-b0af-4ec3-9fd0-3ca98d73a1cf" className="">Automated Distribution</h2><p id="5598a2df-ed72-4b22-89b2-ce4739635af7" className="">After a dtrust is deployed it will execute as long as the ethereum network continues to validate transactions. Price movements, political transformations, or natural disasters will not affect the administration of the assets—the code will just run. This difference from traditional trusts can create added strategic benefits to trust structures. A settlor who wants a pure automated distribution machine without giving anyone abilities to interfere could create a trusteeless dtrust without any control keys. Once funded, the beneficiary wallet addresses would receive their scheduled payments without any possible disruption. Alternatively, a settlor could use a trustee and control keys to retain some human control over the future distributions. In either case, the ability of other parties—banks, courts, regulators—to interfere is lesser in a dtrust compared to traditional legal trusts. A bank can unwind a payment, but a bank cannot fork ethereum. </p><h2 id="008cb6e5-9a26-4c6c-90a5-4b0e00682ccf" className="">Testamentary Freedom </h2><p id="4afdd31a-e529-49bb-8682-4910d2c0a0c7" className="">DTrust creates novel opportunities for settlors who might want to administer an estate differently than local rules would ordinarily prescribe. Forced heirship rules in many countries mandate certain divisions of decedent estates. Similarly, many jurisdictions do not have trusts or similar legal structures. Settlors under these circumstances might use a dtrust within the local rules to craft an appropriate solution. See the &quot;Regional Guides&quot; for regional descriptions of forced heirship rules. </p><p id="7ca8c2d6-efc8-427a-8a4a-e6008271b096" className="">

He developed a great love for visual art, particularly in the form of NFTs. He purchased some visual art NFTs over the years that became highly valuable. Now, grandpa is aging rapidly, and he is noticing his own cognitive abilities slipping away. Granddaughter also likes art, and she particularly likes one of Grandpa&#x27;s NFTs. Granddaughter notices Grandpa&#x27;s mental decline. Granddaughter hears from Mother that Grandpa wants his NFT&#x27;s to be shared among his grandchildren. Granddaughter excitedly asks Grandpa if she will receive her favorite NFT. He says she certainly will. </p><p id="7a28b4d9-0989-4d66-ac4d-4e8785378fa2" className="">Grandpa&#x27;s real property assets are subject to a will drawn up by a local attorney. The will assigns the real property assets to his children. Grandpa decides to put his NFT&#x27;s into a dtrust. Grandpa works with his children to specify the dtrust details at dtrust.io. Each grandchild receives control of a wallet that will receive NFTs at a time long in the future. Mother is the trustee for the dtrust, and she receives a key that allows her to change the NFT distribution schedules. </p><p id="0ac5a9b3-f2af-4cf1-a83d-913375140b11" className="">As Grandpa&#x27;s mental faculties fade, he starts to take an interest in a new home care nurse. The home care nurse takes very good care of Grandpa, listens to his stories for hours, tells him about her hopes for the future, and tells him about her money problems. Grandpa starts to enjoy his time spent with the nurse. He feels a new youthfulness from talking to her and his health improves. </p><p id="9bdfc2f2-69a4-4286-a537-e370ab950700" className="">One day, after seeing a news program on TV about a local political event, he feels a terrible anger towards his extended family. He calls the lawyer holding the will and asks the lawyer to give nothing to his family. &quot;Give it all to the nurse,&quot; Grandpa says. The lawyer consults the relevant rules and decides that she must follow Grandpa&#x27;s direction. The lawyer drafts a new will to give all of grandpa&#x27;s assets to the nurse. </p><p id="81481fd9-c276-4158-a5cd-0fd1c193b538" className="">Shortly thereafter, grandpa suddenly dies of respiratory failure during an afternoon nap. The home care nurse was the only one in the home at the time, and she feels terrible that she wasn&#x27;t able to prevent Grandpa&#x27;s death. </p><p id="53757444-6a83-4a34-b16e-f3549faba7fb" className="">Mother is quite saddened when she learns that Grandpa&#x27;s real property will all go to the nurse who knew grandpa for just a few weeks, but thankfully the NFTs are held in the dtrust, so Mother uses her control key to trigger the NFT distributions to the grandchildren. </p><p id="64de1184-6e05-4f0b-8f1c-7379bcd39913" className="">Granddaughter is thankful to receive her favorite NFT to remember her Grandpa by. </p></details></li></ul></div></article>
