Like a legal trust, a dtrust cannot reduce US income tax obligations, however it can comply with the tax code without triggering certain burdensome results. DTrust enables the same strategies that have made trusts ubiquitous tax planning tools, while offering certain advantages over traditional legal trusts. Fundamentally, like legal trusts dtrusts are about separating the enjoyment and control of assets. </p><p id="e3ad763c-7c13-49af-918a-4fd221358b09" class="">When a person dies, governments around the world take portions of a decedents assets, whether through an estate or an inheritance tax. Irrevocable trusts have been used to reduce these taxes, because the assets are already held in the trust at the time of the decedent&#x27;s death and the trust continues to exist after the decedent&#x27;s death. In other words, if the assets are in an irrevocable trust, then there is no transfer upon the decedent&#x27;s death, so estate and inheritance taxes are not triggered. Whether or not a dtrust is a legal trust, an irrevocable dtrust could avoid estate and inheritance taxes in the US or elsewhere, because the assets are not held by the decedent, and there is not transfer upon the decedent&#x27;s death. </p><p id="5f6a64a5-5205-432c-8e08-78d813337dce" class="">Another tax strategy that uses trusts is the &quot;Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust&quot; (IDGT). These are irrevocable trusts that give the settlor (or grantor) certain rights to the trust assets. The result is a hybrid trust that receives optimal treatment under income tax, estate tax, and asset protection rules. For example, an IDGT might give the grantor a right to swap trust assets for assets of equivalent value, but no other rights to trust assets. This IDGT would be considered a complete gift for asset protection and estate tax purposes—creditors cannot reach the assets and there is no estate tax. On the other hand, this IDGT would be considered an incomplete gift—a &quot;grantor trust&quot;— for income tax purposes, because the grantor retains the right to swap the assets. A grantor trust is better for income tax purposes, because it avoids the heavy compressed tax rate tables applied to income earned by a non-grantor trust. Instead, the settlor pays the tax on trust income on the higher personal income rate tables. DTrust allows a settlor to retain an asset swap key when forming a dtrust, which would create the same trust structure as the classic IDGT. A more powerful way to achieve the IDGT strategy with DTrust is to simply select the button to not form a legal trust on the form a dtrust page. Most US states have adopted the Uniform Trust Act which requires a settlor to intend to form a trust in order for a valid trust to be created. If a dtrust settlor indicates an intention to not form a legal trust, then the dtrust is not a legal trust, and therefore it does not face the compressed trust tax rate tables. An irrevocable dtrust that is not a legal trust therefore has significant tax advantages over an irrevocable legal trust. Settlor&#x27;s can achieve the benefits of a non-grantor trust, without forming a legal trust. </p><p id="cdcc2587-5eee-4b60-b0b3-4375472b8413" class="">This is the crux of DTrust. Traditional legal trusts are contracts which implicate the state to enforce them. If I wanted to schedule a stream of payments long after my death without a dtrust, I would rely on someone to execute those payments. It may be a trustee, a financial institution, or some other contract. In each case, my assurance that the payment made is that the courts would enforce the terms of the trust or contract. The only way I can rest assured that some future treatment of asset is achieved is to rely on courts and legal institutions to enforce some agreement after my death. Taxation has developed around these activities, at least theoretically because I am relying on courts to uphold the trust. I rely on the courts to achieve this goal—the government takes a piece. </p><p id="0810e9bd-a918-4a25-90d7-8c23811d3e8d" class="">DTrust enables scheduled future asset treatment, without any reliance on courts or financial institutions. Unlike foreign trusts, which are subject to special reporting requirements and punitive fines, a dtrust also does not rely on courts in some offshore jurisdiction. Instead, the enforcement is achieved by the ethereum network validating the smart contracts. I do not need to form a legal trust to achieve my goals, and therefore my assets will not be taxed as trust assets. Countries all over the world tax trust assets with various systems. Now you can achieve the goals of a trust, without forming a trust under the laws of some jurisdiction. This is the power of DTrust. </p><p id="f6363977-3b67-47d4-8d48-89201eba1814" class="">

T estimates that her estate will owe $555,555 in taxes upon T&#x27;s death, but the truth is that she could never know the amount for certain. </p><p id="4e5fc534-4980-48bf-9810-5603ec9d707d" class="">T decides to form a dtrust. She speaks with a professional trustee who agrees to be the trustee. T specifies some control keys for herself and gives some keys to the professional trustee. T and the professional trustee decide to make the dtrust a legal trust, which requires that they intend to form a legal trust in the relavant jurisdiction. Now the dtrust is subject to all the normal rules of traditional legal trusts—DTrust.io is simply a tool to operate the trust. T clicks &quot;Form dtrust&quot;, the keys go out to wallets, and information goes out to email addresses. T sells her BTC, buys wBTC, and funds the dtrust with the wBTC.</p><p id="cab47027-c869-40cb-911c-14008f433d58" class="">Now T expects that her estate, and all its beneficiaries including children and charities, will receive $555,555 more in value thanks to the dtrust. The assets will not transfer as an estate, and therefore will not be subject to the estate tax. </p></details></li></ul><p id="50dd1072-49d5-4add-ac76-ebc909d88985" class="">
