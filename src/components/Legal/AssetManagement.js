A settlor can allow the trustee to transact with dtrust assets, which would enable a dtrust to function within a traditional asset management legal structure or as a stand-alone asset management infrastructure. The dtrust would replace the legal and financial institution infrastructure that asset managers already rely on. As long as good faith fiduciary relationships are maintained by other legal requirements or something else, a dtrust could provide the technological infrastructure for an asset management relationship. </p><p id="5c6dd26d-fa18-47ad-948d-fab8b529e83d" className="">
</p><ul id="a8dc2afa-1634-48e6-bdb4-542026865fb1" className="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary><strong>Asset Management Hypothetical</strong></summary><p id="15e3a688-6a38-4aea-b359-34451e386f7c" nam="">One way or another, an idea starts to spread that people with big hands are bad. The idea is that people with big hands are closely related to birds, and big hands are vestiges of bird wings. Birds are bad, because birds can fly, while other animals are stuck on the ground. That is not fair, these big-hand-bad people claim. Big handed people should take actions to rectify the situation. </p><p id="c910a534-5e6a-4292-8ca1-583edbd3075f" nam="">X has really big hands. He has worked for many years and accumulated some securities and bonds with an asset manager called M at at local bank. X has worked with M for many years and they trust each other very much. </p><p id="4e7d416a-1c23-48bb-9abd-a2ea25849f82" nam="">The big-hand-bad idea is becoming more and more popular in the local press and educational institutions. X is a bit disturbed by this development, but what can he do? X sees on social media that some people with big hands pay surgeons to have their big hands amputated or at least to have their fingers partially chopped off to show shame for their big hands. Now X is quite disturbed. X does not want to chop off his hands. X keeps his hands in his pockets when he goes out, but it is not a good solution. Whenever people see his hands, they recoil in disgust. </p><p id="25cc95aa-f27f-4191-8f35-b96ea4ac6ce8" nam="">One day, X gets a call from M. M says, &quot;X I&#x27;m really sorry. I want to manage these assets for you, but I think it might be illegal for me to work with you. There are some new regulations that require me to submit documentation on the hand sizes of all my clients. I am pretty sure that your hands are bigger than the limit for financial services. I am going to either lose my license or stop working with you. These regulators really mean business. If you promise to never show your hands in public and to record an apology video about your hands, I might be able to negotiate with my boss, but I am not sure you want to do that. The bank has changed policies recently.&quot; </p><p id="223df516-4dde-474e-810f-e0c839f75aa7" nam="">X replies to M, &quot;What if you quit working for the bank? You could provide big hand financial services through <a href="http://dtrust.io">dtrust.io</a>. I would trust you more if you were independent and free from the bank anyways. What good do the fiduciary regulations do me if the regulations require you to treat me worse based on my big hands? I&#x27;d trust you more if you were free from the regulators. If you want to keep my business, quit working for the bank, and we can use dtrust.io to govern our relationship.&quot; </p><p id="461ded2a-c22d-44b3-98db-bce33a9a155c" nam="">After some research, M agrees. X and M visit dtrust.io. M will be the trustee and X will be the settlor and sole beneficiary. X keeps a control key to change the distribution schedule and also a key to revoke the dtrust. M gets a key to transact with the assets. They decide that they do not want the dtrust to be a legal trust, because X does not trust the courts to treat him fairly. X converts his assets into ethereum compatible assets and funds the dtrust with those assets. </p><p id="6642a0f1-7611-46b2-ae44-eaf6579c8b59" nam="">X truly trusts M and he is happy to be able to enjoy M&#x27;s asset management services without relying on courts or financial institutions. The big-hand-bad lobby is powerful enough to sway the courts and financial institutions, but the lobby cannot fork ethereum. </p></details></li></ul><p id="520d74a6-3803-4ae6-8401-b582cfca256a" nam="">
