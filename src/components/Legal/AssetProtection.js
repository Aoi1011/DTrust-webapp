New claimants on a person&#x27;s assets might not be able to reach assets held in a trust. Certain jurisdictions such as the Cook Islands, South Dakota, and Wyoming have earned reputations as attractive asset protection trust jurisdictions. A dtrust runs on the ethereum network, which provides certain advantages over even these most secure trust jurisdictions. </p><p id="42f2ae6c-a825-4eb7-922a-0aefab657ada" className="">
</p><p id="621b6d9e-c85b-4bd4-b76a-ada707a1e955" className="">How do asset protection trusts protect assets? Even the Supreme Court of the United States has limited jurisdiction. If a court does not have jurisdiction over a person with control of assets under the terms of a trust, then the court cannot access the assets in the trust. Settlors cannot revoke irrevocable trusts, so a court cannot compel a settlor to use the assets in a trust to pay claimants. Similarly, spendthrift trusts do not allow beneficiary rights to be transferred, so a court cannot compel a beneficiary to use the assets in a trust to pay a claimant. </p><p id="7e45c6b2-2b89-426c-b672-2eaf35cc0e8a" className="">Often, multiple trusts are used to create stronger asset protection. For example, a domestic revocable trust might be held by a foreign irrevocable trust under terms which transfer the assets to the foreign trust if some event occurs. The assets become unreachable by the settlor&#x27;s creditors, because the settlor himself can no longer revoke the trust to recover the assets. These trust structures are governed by lengthy terms written in verbal languages. </p><p id="d4d912b3-426c-4465-bf0b-c748e53007f0" className="">DTrust translates those terms into the language of ethereum—solidity—to create seamless, direct, and easy-to-use dtrusts. For example, a settlor can form a revocable dtrust to hold his assets for the benefit of his children, a charity, or someone else. The settlor retains the control keys specified at the time of the creation of the dtrust. There may or may not be a trustee who also holds control keys. The beneficiaries control wallets that will receive the future distributions. If the settlor needs the assets, then the settlor can simply use the revocation key to recover the assets. If the settlor wants to protect the dtrust assets from future claimants, then the settlor can destroy the settlor&#x27;s control keys. </p><p id="2eb6cadb-da2e-4243-abde-e5b3316718e0" className="">There are many other potential strategies to do with dtrusts, because dtrusts are customizable. DTrust can generate more than 512 different dtrust permutations with different control structures to create a variety of asset protection strategies. For example, a dtrust may give a settlor a key to swap the dtrust assets for assets of equivalent value, which could create the commonly used &quot;intentionally defective grantor trust&quot;. </p><p id="3a6e845f-c0a6-4682-b517-0f7510080596" className="">As with traditional legal trusts, the key to asset protection is to be prepared—hold your assets in dtrust now so that you can protect them later. </p><p id="c71cb3aa-252a-4053-a357-d5008e3d8ce9" className="">

J also has some digital assets. J has bought 0.5 BTC and 10 ETH with income from her dentistry practice. J has a teenage daughter. One of her classNamemates from dentist school was sued by a patient who suffered a complication from a procedure. J&#x27;s classNamemate lost all her assets including a home. J is sorry for her classNamemate, and she is also worried for herself, because she knows that her classNamemate was especially competent and conscientious. </p><p id="9f4d2c5a-d0d5-4d69-ab68-9e5df8c16fd6" className="">J decides to keep her digital assets in a dtrust. J goes to <a href="http://dtrust.io/">dtrust.io</a>. J clicks “Start”. J clicks “Form a dtrust”. J is going to specify exactly how this dtrust is going to function. J asks her classNamemate to be the trustee for the dtrust. J decides to give her classNamemate a revocation key, and J keeps a revocation and a distribution schedule key for herself. J creates two beneficiary wallets: J keeps personal control of one beneficiary wallet and gives control of the other wallet to J&#x27;s daughter. J does not schedule any asset distributions—for now J simply wants the assets to stay in the dtrust. Several years go by and the prices of the assets move up and down. </p><p id="13c8c15b-9329-4961-b85d-a850ca3be339" className="">The state legislature passes an amendment to the torts statute that changes the word &quot;reasonable&quot; to &quot;competent&quot; in a part of the statute. J sees an email about the change from a dentistry association that J is a part of, but no one really knows what exactly the change in wording will mean. A few weeks later a new lawyer moves to J&#x27;s part of the city. The lawyer erects a billboard across the street from J&#x27;s dentist office that says: &quot;WERE YOU HARMED BY YOUR DENTIST? GET JUSTICE NOW. CALL 1-800-GET-PAID&quot;. J is a bit alarmed, but J continues her practice. Not long thereafter, J starts to get letters in the mail from courts, lawyers, and former clients alleging all sorts of harm resulting from J&#x27;s dentistry practice. Is J liable? No one really knows—the courts are going to have to work out what exactly the new statute means. </p><p id="887526fa-0868-4e3b-bcbb-1cc4f56338cc" className="">J visits dtrust.io. J uses her distribution schedule key to change the distribution schedule of the dtrust. J schedules all of the 0.5 BTC to go to her daughter&#x27;s wallet on the date of her daughter&#x27;s graduation later that year. J also schedules 0.5 ETH to go to her daughter&#x27;s wallet each month starting next year until all the ETH is distributed. That will help support her daughter&#x27;s further education. Lastly, J destroys her revocation and distribution schedule keys. J could still get the assets back if J&#x27;s dentist school trustee friend uses the revocation key to end the dtrust, but for now J is happy to use the digital assets to support her daughter. </p><p id="43656d4a-c7cb-4453-a769-aec5bab513f3" className="">Over the next few months, all the lawsuits against J fail, but J was glad to be able to protect her assets in the dtrust. J is glad that she prepared with a dtrust long before. </p></details></li></ul><ul id="c371b2de-87fc-46a1-9dac-6ada2a8f588a" className="toggle"><li><details open=""><summary><strong>Asset Protection and Other Hypothetical</strong></summary><p id="bae9831d-6b23-4668-9bf0-ad254d2b4b34" className="">R has 3 BTC, 30,000 USDT, 20 ETH, and some securities. R has three children. The children are each different ages. R also attends a local church. R is 68 and has a heart condition. R might die sometime. R also might get sued in relation to some real estate transactions in which R could incur substantial liabilities. R wants to form a trust to make sure that the assets go where R wants them to go no matter what happens. </p><p id="b72d7441-5235-472a-8af9-0e2c6d16f208" className="">He decides to use a dtrust. R sells his BTC and buys wBTC. R sells his securities and buys ethereum based synthetics. R goes to <a href="http://dtrust.io/">dtrust.io</a>. R clicks “Start”. R clicks “Form a dtrust”. R is going to specify exactly how this dtrust is going to function. R has a very trustworthy cousin, so R asks his cousin to be a trustee. R decides to give his cousin a control key to change the distribution schedule, but no other control keys. In order to keep his cousin happy, R gives his cousin a 0.5% annual fee from the assets. R thinks R might want to take all the assets back someday in the future, so R keeps a revocation control key for himself. In fact, R wants to retain as much control as possible, so R gives himself all the control keys that are available. R decides to not make this dtrust a legal trust, because there are not any benefits to his situation. </p><p id="b174dd4b-3268-4e46-b49b-fb88abc35603" className="">R also needs to specify how his assets will be distributed. R and his cousin can change these schedules later with their control keys, but this schedule will be the default distributions to beneficiary wallets. </p><p id="a4e8c782-fdc4-411e-9979-42f02b987a8e" className="">BTC: R decides to give one BTC to each child on their 25th birthdays. One beneficiary wallet gets one btc on July 7, 2025. Another beneficiary wallet gets one btc on Jan. 10, 2026. Finally the last btc goes to the last beneficiary wallet on April 5, 2035.</p><p id="6213c43f-6774-4b6a-adb9-f9391f8e345b" className="">USDT: The oldest child is a promising student who wants to become a professor and R wants to give some monthly support. R wants to schedule $300 monthly payments to the oldest child’s wallet starting next month and continuing until all the USDT is gone.</p><p id="9fd6b93e-7501-4742-b71e-ee92a4d43606" className="">ETH: R wants to give his local church $1000 each month worth of ETH. The price of ETH changes, so the precise amount of ETH will change, but R wants it to be $1000. R could give it all now in a lump sum payment, but R thinks the priest might misspend the money so R wants to schedule out the payments. How long it takes to distribute all that ETH is uncertain, because it depends on the price of ETH. Maybe some ETH will stay in the dtrust forever or until its distribution is changed by someone with a control key.</p><p id="55f25169-2ea0-4ee7-b79c-e00f2ffa4b01" className="">Synthetic Securities: These are indivisible, so it is a bit different. Let’s imagine that R has a lot of value in the securities. R bought Apple stock a long time ago. R is not sure to whom R wants to give them. R creates a new wallet and schedules all the securities to go to that new wallet 100 years from today. Then R puts the private key to control that wallet in a cold storage device and stores it in a safety deposit box that is controlled by a legal trust that R created under the law of South Dakota with a corporate trustee. </p><p id="ecadaaa0-650e-4574-9ca9-1d83611eaf6a" className="">What happens next? Everyone keeps control keys and wallet private keys online or in cold storage devices. The USD values of the BTC, ETH, and synths fluctuate daily. Semiannual charges of 0.5% come out of the BTC, ETH, and USDT to pay DTrust. R&#x27;s cousin also gets his payment. </p><p id="1ae1a269-ada3-4003-a2ee-6dc811d775e7" className="">It turns out that R&#x27;s middle child is a brilliant mathematician. The child wins some awards and starts a computer engineering company as a young adult. By the time the middle child is 23, the company is doing well. The middle child is quite proud of himself—perhaps too proud. The middle child boasts about succeeding without help from anyone. R is also proud, so R uses a control key to turn off the payment of the second BTC to the middle child. </p><p id="2f951e79-f3ed-44c6-b9f2-6187c0717af6" className="">The oldest child has also succeeded to become an academic, but a problem has arisen. The oldest child was in a bad car accident, and it is unclear who is at fault. Ten people were hurt and the medical bills are rapidly building up. R&#x27;s oldest child might have been at fault, but it is unclear. Litigation will probably go on for some time. As soon as R hears about the accident, R tells the cousin trustee about it. The cousin trustee is worried about his first cousin once removed. The cousin trustee also decides to use his control key to turn off all future payments to the oldest child&#x27;s wallet—both the USDT payments and the BTC payment. Even if the oldest child faces substantial liabilities, the wallet in the oldest child&#x27;s control is now longer valuable. </p><p id="15413353-8c48-4f16-a17e-52f9c0c3294b" className="">R is now retired and has a bit more time on his hands. R has always liked dogs, so R started to volunteer at a local dog shelter to walk the dogs. The shelter is a part of a national network of dog shelters that educates people, cares for abused and stray dogs, finds homes for dogs, and keeps stray dogs off of streets. After spending many hours at the shelter, R likes this organization very much. R decides to give his securities to the national foundation, so R contacts his South Dakota corporate trustee. R asks that the contents of the safety deposit box go to the dog shelter national foundation when R dies. </p><p id="9086d015-94d3-4eea-94fd-9bb3ecbae008" className="">Years later, R is on vacation in another country when a terrible pandemic restricts global travel for several months. R is stranded in this foreign country. Worse yet, local political dynamics in that country have intensified and it looks like one group is going to take power in the government. R is monitoring the situation from his apartment. A new government takes control in the midst of the pandemic as the world is locked down. The new government decides that all digital assets should be repossessed by the government to fund the replacement of old statues with new ones to honor the new government and to buy medical supplies from overseas. R doesn&#x27;t speak the local language and the english language media is not functioning well, but R hears about this plan from a friend that R made in the country. Government officials begin going door to door interrogating people about any digital assets, searching hardware devices, and sending all accessible digital assets to the new government&#x27;s wallets. R has some control keys for his dtrust in a hardware device in his suitcase. Naturally, R is quite unhappy about these events. R has a few options to prevent the confiscation of the dtrust assets. R could lie to the officials, throw his hardware device into the sea, or visit <a href="http://dtrust.io">dtrust.io</a> to permanently destroy his control keys. R doesn&#x27;t want to risk unpleasant interrogation methods, and R doesn&#x27;t want to pollute the sea, so R destroys the keys at dtrust.io. When the officials interrogate him, R truthfully tells them that he has no digital assets or access to any wallet. </p><p id="90f4c70c-437e-4f67-a9b3-496a2562a829" className="">After the pandemic abates, R returns home. R is now quite old and the whole ordeal with the pandemic and the government officials was a bit exasperating. R is quite weakened now. R dies in his sleep shortly after returning home. None of the digital assets will go through the probate process. None of the digital assets will be a part of the estate subject to estate and inheritance taxes. All of the assets will be either distributed according to the preprogrammed schedules or under the control of the cousin and corporate trustees. </p></details></li></ul><p id="7d20f058-e4a2-4e13-9ab6-eef6189db78a" className="">
